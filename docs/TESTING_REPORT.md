### Test Statistics

- **Total Tests Created**: 138 tests
- **Tests Passing**: 138 (100% pass rate)
- **Test Execution Time**: ~20 seconds
- **Lines Covered**: 1,238 out of 3,727 total lines

## Test Infrastructure Created

### 1. Test Fixtures (`tests/test_fixtures.py`)

**Purpose**: Provide reusable mock objects and configuration for consistent testing.

**Key Components**:
- `MockConfig`: Fully configured mock configuration object with all required attributes
- Sample paper fixtures for testing data flow
- API response generators for each harvester type (arXiv, CrossRef, Semantic Scholar)
- `MockLLMService`: Mock service for testing LLM extraction functionality

**Usage Example**:
```python
def test_harvester(mock_config):
    harvester = CrossRefHarvester(mock_config)
    assert harvester.delay_milliseconds == 10
```

### 2. Test Utilities (`tests/test_utils.py`)

**Purpose**: Helper functions and utilities for common testing patterns.

**Key Components**:
- Context managers for mocking HTTP requests and time delays
- Assertion helpers for rate limiting and data validation
- Test data generators for creating varied test papers
- Batch processing helpers for concurrent operations
- Extraction validation utilities

**Usage Example**:
```python
with mock_time_sleep() as mock_sleep:
    papers = harvester.search("test query")
    assert_rate_limiting_applied(mock_sleep, expected_calls=2)
```

### 3. Example Usage (`tests/harvesters/test_example_harvester_usage.py`)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate best practices for using test utilities.

**Coverage Areas**:
- Mock configuration usage
- API response mocking
- Rate limiting verification
- Error scenario testing
- Complete workflow testing
