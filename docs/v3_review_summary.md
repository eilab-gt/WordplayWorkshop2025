# v3.0.0 Implementation Review Summary

## Review Findings

### Critical Issues Found and Fixed

#### 1. NEAR Operators in Comments (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: The most critical issue was that NEAR operators for positive search terms were placed in comments instead of being part of the actual search terms.

**Before**:
```yaml
- "red team*" # NEAR/5 (exercise OR simulation OR wargame OR campaign OR tabletop)
```

**After** (Fixed):
```yaml
- '"red team*" NEAR/5 (exercise OR simulation OR wargame OR campaign OR tabletop)'
```

**Impact**: This fix significantly improves search precision by ensuring proximity searches work as intended.

### Issues Identified but Not Fixed

#### 2. Character Encoding Discrepancy ⚠️
- Spec uses non-standard hyphens (‑) in 70 places
- Implementation uses standard hyphens (-)
- **Impact**: May slightly affect search recall, but most search engines normalize these

#### 3. Missing Features ❌
- **Secondary Query Strategies**: Defined in config but not implemented
- **CNKI Support**: No Chinese database harvester
- **Cloudflare Bypass**: No implementation for .gov/.mil access
- **Automation**: No cron jobs or monitoring

#### 4. Configuration Not Fully Used ⚠️
- Source-specific optimizations (arxiv categories, semantic_scholar fields) are hardcoded rather than read from config

### Correctly Implemented Features ✅

1. **Query Translation**: NEAR operators and wildcards properly handled per platform
2. **Disambiguation Logic**: All rules including positive_required working correctly
3. **Grey Literature Tagging**: Properly identifies .mil, .gov, .nato.int sources
4. **Export System**: Excluded papers exported for human review
5. **Year Range**: Correctly set to 2022-2025

## Priority Recommendations

### Must Fix Before Production:
1. ✅ **NEAR Operators** - Already fixed
2. **Implement Secondary Queries** - Critical for finding policy games and grey literature

### Should Fix Soon:
1. **Use Config Values** - Make harvesters read from config instead of hardcoding
2. **Character Encoding** - Consider normalizing non-standard hyphens

### Nice to Have:
1. **CNKI Support** - For international coverage
2. **Cloudflare Bypass** - For better .gov/.mil access
3. **Automation** - For ongoing monitoring

## Testing Results

After fixing NEAR operators:
- Config correctly contains NEAR patterns
- Query builder properly translates them for each platform
- Google Scholar: Converts to phrase combinations
- arXiv: Converts to AND logic
- Semantic Scholar: Simplifies to keywords

## Conclusion

The v3.0.0 implementation is largely correct with one critical issue (NEAR operators) now fixed. The missing features are mostly additions rather than errors in existing code. The system should now achieve better precision for searches, though implementing secondary query strategies would improve recall for policy games and grey literature.

### Ready for Production?
**Yes, with caveats:**
- Core search functionality works correctly
- Critical NEAR operator issue has been fixed
- Missing features can be added incrementally
- Monitor precision/recall metrics to verify targets are met
