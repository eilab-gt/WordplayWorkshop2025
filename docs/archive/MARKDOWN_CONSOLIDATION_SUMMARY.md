## 📁 Archive Structure
```
docs/reports/archive/
├── pipeline_testing/     # 6 original pipeline testing reports
├── cleanup/              # 1 old cleanup report
tests/e2e/archive/        # 3 original E2E optimization reports
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add timestamps**: Consider adding "Last Updated" to all reports
2. **Regular review**: Schedule quarterly consolidation reviews
3. **Update references**: Check if any docs reference the old report names
4. **Consider further consolidation**:
   - `PROJECT_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` + `PROJECT_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`
   - Various testing-related docs in root `docs/`

## 📝 Notes

- All consolidations preserved key information while removing redundancy
- Original files archived, not deleted, for historical reference
- Focus was on reports with significant overlap or duplicate content
- Standalone technical reports (e.g., API analysis, architecture) left as-is
