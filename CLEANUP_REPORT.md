# Cleanup Report - 2025-07-27

## Summary
Performed safe cleanup of the WordplayWorkshop2025 codebase, focusing on removing generated files and identifying code quality improvements.

## Actions Taken

### âœ… Completed
1. **Removed Cache Files**
   - Deleted all `__pycache__` directories (85 .pyc files)
   - Removed coverage reports (`.coverage`, `htmlcov/`)
   - Cleaned up log files (`test_results.log`)
   - Removed package info (`wordplayworkshop2025.egg-info/`)

### ðŸ“‹ Identified for Future Action

1. **Test File Consolidation** (Recommended)
   - `test_content_cache.py` â†’ merge into `test_content_cache_comprehensive.py`
   - `test_batch_processor.py` â†’ merge into `test_batch_processor_comprehensive.py`
   - `test_pdf_fetcher.py` and `test_pdf_fetcher_refactored.py` â†’ keep only `test_pdf_fetcher_comprehensive.py`
   - Keep both `conftest.py` and `conftest_enhanced.py` (they serve different purposes)

2. **Code Quality Improvements** (Optional)
   - 6 hardcoded `/tmp/` paths in test files (acceptable for test code)
   - 100+ print statements in tests (acceptable for test output)
   - `src/example.py` - example code only used by example notebook

## Results
- **Disk space saved**: ~2MB from cache and coverage files
- **Repository cleaner**: No generated files in version control
- **No breaking changes**: All cleanup was non-destructive

## Next Steps
1. Consider consolidating duplicate test files (manual review recommended)
2. Add `.gitignore` entries for cleaned file types if not already present
3. Run tests to ensure everything still works: `pytest`

## Notes
- Used `--safe` mode: only removed generated files, no code changes
- Preserved all hardcoded paths and print statements (common in test code)
- Test file duplicates appear to be from incomplete refactoring - manual review recommended before removal
