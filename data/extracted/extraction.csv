SCREEN_0001,Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self-Play: Approach to Approximate Nash equilibrium of Imperfect-Information Games,Li Zhang; Wei Wang; Shijian Li; Gang Pan,2019,,"Researchers on artificial intelligence have achieved human-level intelligence in large-scale perfect-information games, but it is still a challenge to achieve (nearly) optimal results (in other words, an approximate Nash Equilibrium) in large-scale imperfect-information games (i.e. war games, football coach or business strategies). Neural Fictitious Self Play (NFSP) is an effective algorithm for learning approximate Nash equilibrium of imperfect-information games from self-play without prior domain knowledge. However, it relies on Deep Q-Network, which is off-line and is hard to converge in online games with changing opponent strategy, so it can't approach approximate Nash equilibrium in games with large search scale and deep search depth. In this paper, we propose Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self Play (MC-NFSP), an algorithm combines Monte Carlo tree search with NFSP, which greatly improves the performance on large-scale zero-sum imperfect-information games. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed Monte Carlo Neural Fictitious Self Play can converge to approximate Nash equilibrium in games with large-scale search depth while the Neural Fictitious Self Play can't. Furthermore, we develop Asynchronous Neural Fictitious Self Play (ANFSP). It use asynchronous and parallel architecture to collect game experience. In experiments, we show that parallel actor-learners have a further accelerated and stabilizing effect on training.",,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09569v2,arxiv,1.0,Automated: relevance score 7/10,,,,,,,pdf_cache/pdfs/7a8983a7a83be829.pdf,downloaded_direct,1903.095692,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09569v2.pdf,cs.AI,4f21fd276371a4b6f7a4737622e8dbae85db2de46c2bc2204265d10ef51b06c7,automated,2025-07-27,,,,en,7,True,Automated: relevance score 7/10,tech-report,digital,no,yes,none,none,"Exploitability, convergence to Nash equilibrium, training time, win rate against human players",,2,none,yes,success,1.0,,,,win_rate,
SCREEN_0002,HARK Side of Deep Learning -- From Grad Student Descent to Automated Machine Learning,Oguzhan Gencoglu; Mark van Gils; Esin Guldogan; Chamin Morikawa; Mehmet Süzen; Mathias Gruber; Jussi Leinonen; Heikki Huttunen,2019,,"Recent advancements in machine learning research, i.e., deep learning, introduced methods that excel conventional algorithms as well as humans in several complex tasks, ranging from detection of objects in images and speech recognition to playing difficult strategic games. However, the current methodology of machine learning research and consequently, implementations of the real-world applications of such algorithms, seems to have a recurring HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) issue. In this work, we elaborate on the algorithmic, economic and social reasons and consequences of this phenomenon. We present examples from current common practices of conducting machine learning research (e.g. avoidance of reporting negative results) and failure of generalization ability of the proposed algorithms and datasets in actual real-life usage. Furthermore, a potential future trajectory of machine learning research and development from the perspective of accountable, unbiased, ethical and privacy-aware algorithmic decision making is discussed. We would like to emphasize that with this discussion we neither claim to provide an exhaustive argumentation nor blame any specific institution or individual on the raised issues. This is simply a discussion put forth by us, insiders of the machine learning field, reflecting on us.",,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07633v1,arxiv,1.0,Automated: relevance score 7/10,,,,,,,pdf_cache/pdfs/9d3083f2481921ae.pdf,downloaded_direct,1904.076331,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07633v1.pdf,cs.LG,67f8757c0faa1ddab4d95a43c6fe1e6dcdb5c69ebfdfebececaf5e81c74241ea,automated,2025-07-27,,,,en,7,True,Automated: relevance score 7/10,tech-report,none,no,no,none,none,none,,3,none,yes,success,1.0,,,,,
SCREEN_0006,Predicting Tactical Solutions to Operational Planning Problems under Imperfect Information,Eric Larsen; Sébastien Lachapelle; Yoshua Bengio; Emma Frejinger; Simon Lacoste-Julien; Andrea Lodi,2019,"INFORMS Journal on Computing 34(1):227-242, 2021","This paper offers a methodological contribution at the intersection of machine learning and operations research. Namely, we propose a methodology to quickly predict tactical solutions to a given operational problem. In this context, the tactical solution is less detailed than the operational one but it has to be computed in very short time and under imperfect information. The problem is of importance in various applications where tactical and operational planning problems are interrelated and information about the operational problem is revealed over time. This is for instance the case in certain capacity planning and demand management systems. We formulate the problem as a two-stage optimal prediction stochastic program whose solution we predict with a supervised machine learning algorithm. The training data set consists of a large number of deterministic (second stage) problems generated by controlled probabilistic sampling. The labels are computed based on solutions to the deterministic problems (solved independently and offline) employing appropriate aggregation and subselection methods to address uncertainty. Results on our motivating application in load planning for rail transportation show that deep learning algorithms produce highly accurate predictions in very short computing time (milliseconds or less). The prediction accuracy is comparable to solutions computed by sample average approximation of the stochastic program.",10.1287/ijoc.2021.1091,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07935v4,arxiv,1.0,Automated: relevance score 7/10,,,,,,,,not_found,1901.079354,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07935v4.pdf,cs.LG; math.OC; stat.ML,,automated,2025-07-27,,,,en,7,True,Automated: relevance score 7/10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,accuracy,
SCREEN_0007,Relative Hausdorff Distance for Network Analysis,Sinan G. Aksoy; Kathleen E. Nowak; Emilie Purvine; Stephen J. Young,2019,,"Similarity measures are used extensively in machine learning and data science algorithms. The newly proposed graph Relative Hausdorff (RH) distance is a lightweight yet nuanced similarity measure for quantifying the closeness of two graphs. In this work we study the effectiveness of RH distance as a tool for detecting anomalies in time-evolving graph sequences. We apply RH to cyber data with given red team events, as well to synthetically generated sequences of graphs with planted attacks. In our experiments, the performance of RH distance is at times comparable, and sometimes superior, to graph edit distance in detecting anomalous phenomena. Our results suggest that in appropriate contexts, RH distance has advantages over more computationally intensive similarity measures.",,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04936v1,arxiv,1.0,Automated: relevance score 7/10,,,,,,,pdf_cache/pdfs/ae9fe789c3893c4a.pdf,downloaded_direct,1906.049361,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04936v1.pdf,cs.DM; cs.LG; cs.SI,7efb0fc13605c475aed431200893732b105ac7e09207779ada44b36407258ee3,automated,2025-07-27,,,,en,7,True,Automated: relevance score 7/10,tech-report,none,no,no,none,none,none,,1,none,yes,success,1.0,,,,,
