Benchmarking Large Language Model (LLM) Performance for Game Playing via Tic-Tac-Toe,Oguzhan Topsakal; Jackson B. Harper,2024,"This study investigates the strategic decision-making abilities of large language models (LLMs) via the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, renowned for its straightforward rules and definitive outcomes. We developed a mobile application coupled with web services, facilitating gameplay among leading LLMs, including Jurassic-2 Ultra by AI21, Claude 2.1 by Anthropic, Gemini-Pro by Google, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 by OpenAI, Llama2-70B by Meta, and Mistral Large by Mistral, to assess their rule comprehension and strategic thinking. Using a consistent prompt structure in 10 sessions for each LLM pair, we systematically collected data on wins, draws, and invalid moves across 980 games, employing two distinct prompt types to vary the presentation of the gameâ€™s status. Our findings reveal significant performance variations among the LLMs. Notably, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Llama2 secured the most wins with the list prompt, while GPT-4, Gemini-Pro, and Mistral Large excelled using the illustration prompt. GPT-4 emerged as the top performer, achieving victory with the minimum number of moves and the fewest errors for both prompt types. This research introduces a novel methodology for assessing LLM capabilities using a game that can illuminate their strategic thinking abilities. Beyond enhancing our comprehension of LLM performance, this study lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complex decision-making scenarios, offering directions for further inquiry and the exploration of LLM limits within game-based frameworks.",crossref,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics13081532,10.3390/electronics13081532,,Electronics,0,,journal-article
Wargaming as a Methodology: The International Crisis Wargame and Experimental Wargaming,Benjamin Schechter; Jacquelyn Schneider; Rachael Shaffer,2021,"Background. Wargaming has a long history as a tool for understanding the complexity of conflict. Although wargames have shown their relevance across topics and time, the immersive nature of wargames and the guild-like communities that surround them have often resisted the social scientific advances that occurred alongside the evolution of warfare. However, recent work raises new possibilities for integrating wargaming practices and social scientific methods. Purpose. Develop the experimental wargaming method and practice. Prioritizing the focus on iteration, control, and generalizability within experimental design can provide new opportunities for wargames to answer broader questions about decision-making, crisis behaviors, and patterns of outcomes. Method. The International Crisis Wargame developed in 2018 demonstrates the viability of experimental wargaming, and models the process of theorizing, designing, developing, and executing these wargames. It also identifies what makes games more or less experimental and details how experimental design influenced choices in the game. Conclusion. Experimental wargames are a promising new tool for both the social science and the wargaming communities. A proposed new research agenda for experimental design within wargames would support this nascent method",crossref,https://doi.org/10.1177/1046878120987581,10.1177/1046878120987581,,Simulation &amp; Gaming,16,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1046878120987581,journal-article
