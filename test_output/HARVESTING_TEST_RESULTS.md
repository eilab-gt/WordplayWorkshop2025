# Literature Review Pipeline - Harvesting Test Results

## Phase 1: ArXiv Harvester Testing

### Test Configuration
- **Query**: ("wargaming" OR "wargame" OR "war game") AND ("LLM" OR "large language model" OR "GPT") AND ("simulation" OR "agent" OR "playing")
- **Max Results**: 5
- **Year Range**: 2023-2024 (from config)

### Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Empty Query Issue**
   - **Problem**: Query building was returning empty: "() AND () AND ()"
   - **Root Cause**: Config loader expects search terms under `search` section, not root level
   - **Fix**: Moved `wargame_terms`, `llm_terms`, `action_terms` under `search` in config
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

2. **Category Extraction Error**
   - **Problem**: "'str' object has no attribute 'term'" when extracting categories
   - **Root Cause**: ArXiv API returns categories as strings, not objects with `.term` attribute
   - **Fix**: Added conditional check: `cat.term if hasattr(cat, 'term') else str(cat)`
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Successful Results

ArXiv harvester successfully retrieved 5 highly relevant papers:

1. **"Exploring Potential Prompt Injection Attacks in Federated Military LLMs"** (2025)
   - Focus on military LLMs, wargaming for security testing
   
2. **"On Large Language Models in National Security Applications"** (2024)
   - Mentions USAF's use of LLMs for wargaming and summarization

3. **"Open-Ended Wargames with Large Language Models"** (2024)
   - Direct match: LLM-powered wargaming system "Snow Globe"

4. **"The Prompt War: How AI Decides on a Military Intervention"** (2025)
   - AI in war games and military planning

5. **"WGSR-Bench: Wargame-based Game-theoretic Strategic Reasoning"** (2025)
   - Wargame benchmark for evaluating LLMs

### Key Observations

1. **Query Effectiveness**: Our search terms successfully found highly relevant papers
2. **Data Quality**: All papers have complete metadata including:
   - Titles, authors, years
   - Abstracts
   - ArXiv IDs and PDF URLs
   - Keywords/categories
   
3. **Deduplication**: No duplicates found (as expected from single source)

4. **Performance**:
   - Query execution: ~2 seconds
   - 5 papers retrieved with rate limiting (333ms between papers)
   - Total operation: ~3 seconds

## Phase 2: Crossref Harvester Testing

### Test Results
- **Query**: Same as ArXiv test
- **Results**: Found 5 papers, filtered to 4 by year, validation removed 2
- **Final**: 2 papers saved
- **Issues**: None - working as expected

### Papers Found
1. **"Benchmarking Large Language Model (LLM) Performance for Game Playing"** - LLM game playing research
2. **"Wargaming as a Methodology"** - Experimental wargaming methodology

### Observations
- Crossref returns more general academic papers
- Some papers lack abstracts or have short abstracts (<50 chars)
- Validation correctly removes incomplete entries

## Phase 3: Combined Harvesting Test

### Test Results
- **Sources**: ArXiv + Crossref (parallel execution)
- **Results**: 6 papers total (3 from each)
- **After Normalization**: 5 papers (1 removed during validation)
- **Deduplication**: No duplicates found between sources

### Key Findings
1. **Parallel Execution**: Works correctly with multiple sources
2. **No Cross-Source Duplicates**: As expected from different databases
3. **Data Quality**: All papers have complete metadata
4. **Performance**: ~9 seconds for parallel search of 2 sources

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Configuration Structure** ✅
   - Search terms must be under `search` section in YAML
   
2. **ArXiv Category Parsing** ✅
   - Categories can be strings or objects with `.term`
   - Fixed with conditional check

3. **Validation Working Correctly** ✅
   - Removes papers without abstracts
   - Enforces minimum abstract length (50 chars)
   - Filters by year range

## Pipeline Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| ArXiv Harvester | ✅ Working | Successfully retrieves relevant papers |
| Crossref Harvester | ✅ Working | Returns broader results |
| Google Scholar | ❌ Disabled | Proxy/CAPTCHA issues |
| Semantic Scholar | 🔄 Not tested | Requires API key |
| Normalizer | ✅ Working | Deduplication ready but not tested with duplicates |
| Parallel Harvesting | ✅ Working | Efficient multi-source search |

### Next Steps

1. ✅ ArXiv harvester is working correctly
2. ✅ Crossref harvester is working correctly
3. ✅ Combined harvesting from multiple sources works
4. 🔄 Test deduplication with intentional duplicates
5. 🔄 Test Semantic Scholar (if API key available)
6. 🔄 Test PDF fetching
7. 🔄 Scale up to larger queries
